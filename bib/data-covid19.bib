                   Using a sufficiently small timestep to avoid discretization
                   errors, Verlet integrators generate a trajectory of particle
                   positions as solutions to the equations of motions. We
                   introduce an integrator based on recurrent neural networks
                   that is trained on trajectories generated using Verlet
                   integrator and learns to propagate the dynamics of particles
                   with timestep up to 4000 times larger compared to the Verlet
                   timestep. We demonstrate significant net speedup of up to
                   32000 for few-particle (1 - 16) 3D systems and over a
                   variety of force fields.",

 @ARTICLE{Petropoulos2020-hh,
   title    = "Forecasting the novel coronavirus {COVID-19}",
   author   = "Petropoulos, Fotios and Makridakis, Spyros",
   abstract = "What will be the global impact of the novel coronavirus
               (COVID-19)? Answering this question requires accurate forecasting
               the spread of confirmed cases as well as analysis of the number
               of deaths and recoveries. Forecasting, however, requires ample
               historical data. At the same time, no prediction is certain as
               the future rarely repeats itself in the same way as the past.
               Moreover, forecasts are influenced by the reliability of the
               data, vested interests, and what variables are being predicted.
               Also, psychological factors play a significant role in how people
               perceive and react to the danger from the disease and the fear
               that it may affect them personally. This paper introduces an
               objective approach to predicting the continuation of the COVID-19
               using a simple, but powerful method to do so. Assuming that the
               data used is reliable and that the future will continue to follow
               the past pattern of the disease, our forecasts suggest a
               continuing increase in the confirmed COVID-19 cases with sizable
               associated uncertainty. The risks are far from symmetric as
               underestimating its spread like a pandemic and not doing enough
               to contain it is much more severe than overspending and being
               over careful when it will not be needed. This paper describes the
               timeline of a live forecasting exercise with massive potential
               implications for planning and decision making and provides
               objective forecasts for the confirmed cases of COVID-19.",

                the spread of pandemics such as H1N1 Influenza. The dynamics of
                epidemic spread in large-scale populations are very complex.
                Further, human behavior, social contact networks, and pandemics
                are closely intertwined and evolve as the epidemic spread.
                Individuals' changing behaviors in response to public policies
                and their evolving perception of how an infectious disease
                outbreak is unfolding can dramatically alter normal social
                interactions. Effective planning and response strategies must
                take these complicated interactions into account. Mathematical
                models are key to understanding the spread of epidemics. In this
                chapter, we discuss a recent approach of diffusion in network
                models for studying the complex dynamics of epidemics in
                large-scale populations. Analyzing these models leads to very
                challenging computational problems. Further, using these models
                for forecasting epidemic spread and developing public health
                policies leads to issues that are characteristic of big data
                applications. The chapter describes the state of the art in
                computational and big data epidemiology.",
